Work In Progress. For the moment you can go look at the `plain-js` example in the `examples`
directory.

The simple example should work without having to set up an http server. Simply open up in the
browser with the following query parameters:

```
?token=<oauth-token>&floorId=<id>&siteUrl=<ioffice-site>
```
